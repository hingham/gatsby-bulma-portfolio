BazaarFellows is a starter framework for developers creating personalized e-commerce sites. The backend, written with graphQL and Apollo, provides a mongoDB for storing user specified items and categories. Gatsby, a fast and modern site generator for React, powers the frontend. Combined with ApolloClient and graphQL queries, developers can count on faster rendering and easier database mutations. A simple CMS system allows logged-in users to add and delete items in the database.
