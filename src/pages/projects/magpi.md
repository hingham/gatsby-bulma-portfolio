Magpi was written to be an open source voice assistant that always listening, but never recording what you say until you ask her to. She is able to track multiple lists of the users choice, add to and delete these lists upon requests, and send the formatted lists as a SMS message straight to your device. Pleasant bird sounds let you know she heard you and is ready to write your lists. Device is designed for local use for ultimate user privacy.
