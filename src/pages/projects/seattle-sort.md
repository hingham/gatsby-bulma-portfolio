Compost? recyling? trash?!? Finally, a tool that helps uses know where to put their garbage. This full stack app was designed for mobile view. It uses the Seattle materials database to help uses determine how to dispose of an item in the best possible way. Users can upload a photo, search by category, or by text input to find their item in the static database. App is powered with express and EJS.
